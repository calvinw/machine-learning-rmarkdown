# Webscraping with rvest

Here we will show how to do webscraping with rvest and the chrome extension selector gadget.
First make sure that you install the rvest package:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
install.packages("rvest")
```

Then once we do this we pick a site we want to get data from. We will follow a technique very similar to the following great explanation of how to do this:

[Online Bargin Hunting in R with rvest](https://jef.works/blog/2019/01/12/online-bargain-hunting-in-R-with-rvest/)

```{r message=FALSE}
library("rvest")
url <- 'https://poshmark.com/category/Women-Jackets_&_Coats-Blazers'
webpage <- read_html(url)
```

Then we use the selector gadget to the part of the website we want to get 

```{r}
content <- html_nodes(webpage,'#tiles-con .title')
length(content) # double check 48 products
```

Lets print out what we found so far:

```{r}
html_text(content)
```
