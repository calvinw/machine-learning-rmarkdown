This notebook follows along with the following video:   

[Exploring Data(part 5) - Multivariate Summaries ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23AT9m1HkOI&list=PLjPbBibKHH18I0mDb_H4uP3egypHIsvMn&index=13)

Like the previous video
we load up our file by using Rcurl instead of like he does in his video. This installs the RCurl package: 

First make sure RCurl is installed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("RCurl")
```

Then make sure it is loaded:

```{r}
library("RCurl")
```

We read in the dataframe like we have before. 

```{r}
textString<-getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/usedcars.csv")
df<-read.csv(text=textString, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df$transmission <- factor(df$transmission)
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

```{r}
#pairs(df)
```
