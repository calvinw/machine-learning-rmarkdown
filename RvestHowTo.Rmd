```{r echo=T, results='hide', message=F, warning=F}
if (!require("rvest")) install.packages("rvest")
library("rvest")
```

We are going to read in a page at H&M and get the items on it:

```{r}
url<-"https://www.imdb.com/movies-in-theaters/"
webpage <- read_html(url)
```

Now we can identify the name of the item:

```{r}
nodes <- html_nodes(webpage, "h4 a")
items <- html_text(nodes)
str(items,20)
```

Lets take a look at the first few values:

```{r}
head(items,20)
```
