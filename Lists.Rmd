Lists are similar to vectors, except they can hold different types. 

They are created with the `list` function. The following example has 4 different elements.

1. The first element is a numeric data type
1. The second element is a logical
1. The third element is a integer 
1. The fourth element is a character 

```{r}
myList<-list(32,TRUE,45L,"hello")
str(myList)
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
```
