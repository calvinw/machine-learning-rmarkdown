```{r, include=FALSE}
assignment<-FALSE
```
Set a equal to `5`
Set b equal to the string "hello" 

```{r include=assignment, eval=FALSE}
a <-  PUT CODE HERE
b <-  PUT CODE HERE
```
```{r include=!assignment}
# a <-  PUT CODE HERE
a <- 5 

#b <-  PUT CODE HERE
b <- "hello" 
```

Subset the vector `c` leaving only the items bigger than 3 

```{r include=assignment, eval=FALSE}
c <-  c(3,4,3,3,2,4,5,6) 
d <-  PUT CODE HERE
print(d)
```
```{r include=!assignment}
c <-  c(3,4,3,3,2,4,5,6) 

# d <-  PUT CODE HERE
d <-  c[c > 3] 

print(d)
```
