Create a dataframe for this data, which shows the advertising expenditures for stores and their sales together with the population size for the stores locations:

| Adv Expenditures ($ thousands) | Pop Size  (millions) | Sales($ thousands) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 50 | 5 | 350 |
| 55 | 4 | 400 |
| 100 | 8 | 500 |
| 30 | 1.5 | 300 |
| 25 | 3.5 | 350 |
| 60 | 1 | 400 |

Then run a multiple regression analyis for predicting Sales from Advertising Expenditures and Population Size for some stores.
